    " A single agent can usually operate effectively using a handful of tools within a single domain, but even using powerful models like `gpt-4`, it can be less effective at using many tools.\n",

    " One way to approach complicated tasks is through a \"divide-and-conquer\" approach: create an specialized agent for each task or domain and route tasks to the correct \"expert\".\n",
    "\n",
    " This notebook (inspired by the paper [AutoGen: Enabling Next-Gen LLM Applications via Multi-Agent Conversation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08155), by Wu, et. al.) shows one way to do this using LangGraph.\n",

If the pattern suits your needs, we recommend combining it with some of the other fundamental patterns described elsewhere in the docs for best performance."

However, while Nakamoto was the original inventor of Bitcoin, as well as the author of its very first implementation, he handed the network alert key and control of the code repository to Gavin Andresen, who later became lead developer at the Bitcoin Foundation. This means every node (computer connected to the Bitcoin network using a client that performs the task of validating and relaying transactions) needs to upgrade before the new blockchain with the hard fork activates and rejects any blocks or transactions from the old blockchain. The Bitcoin mining community also attests that the expansion of mining can help lead to the construction of new solar and wind farms in the future.\\n However, during the first few years of BTC’s existence, the competition between miners was relatively low, allowing the earliest network participants to accumulate significant amounts of coins via regular mining: Satoshi Nakamoto alone is believed to own over a million Bitcoin.\\n Circulating Supply\\nLast 7 Days\\n1\\nBitcoin\\nBTC\\n$742.63B$742,627,501,302\\n$24,626,815,859\\n648,515 BTC\\n19,556,118 BTC\\n2\\nEthereum\\nETH\\n$246.34B$246,344,776,737\\n$10,209,218,975\\n4,983,111 ETH\\n120,240,684 ETH\\n3\\nTether USDt\\nUSDT\\n$89.12B$89,124,988,399\\n$40,358,848,935\\n40,338,344,978 USDT\\n89,079,709,234 USDT\\n4\\nBNB\\nBNB\\n$34.7B$34,698,571,042\\n$646,303,010\\n2,825,578 BNB\\n151,699,002 BNB\\n5\\nXRP\\nXRP\\n$32.88B$32,878,463,447\\n$1,063,536,494\\n1,740,845,268 XRP\\n53,816,975,568 XRP\\n6\\nSolana\\nSOL\\n$25.57B$25,570,646,380\\n$1,898,141,434\\n31,438,258 SOL\\n423,517,746 SOL\\n7\\nUSDC\\nUSDC\\n$24.58B$24,583,039,222\\n$5,502,941,909\\n5,503,672,906 USDC\\n24,586,304,770 USDC\\n8\\nCardano\\nADA\\n$13.52B$13,523,077,499\\n$266,681,346\\n696,135,495 ADA\\n35,300,160,187 ADA\\n9\\nDogecoin\\nDOGE\\n$11.36B$11,356,976,320\\n$627,693,406\\n 7,849,753,028 DOGE\\n142,027,076,384 DOGE\\n10\\nTRON\\nTRX\\n$9.16B$9,156,587,979\\n$263,895,033\\n2,552,062,171 TRX\\n88,551,048,111 TRX\\nToday’s Cryptocurrency Prices, Charts and Data\\nWelcome to CoinMarketCap.com!

This means every node (computer connected to the Bitcoin network using a client that performs the task of validating and relaying transactions) needs to upgrade before the new blockchain with the hard fork activates and rejects any blocks or transactions from the old blockchain. The Bitcoin mining community also attests that the expansion of mining can help lead to the construction of new solar and wind farms in the future.\\\\n However, during the first few years of BTC\\\\u2019s existence, the competition between miners was relatively low, allowing the earliest network participants to accumulate significant amounts of coins via regular mining: Satoshi Nakamoto alone is believed to own over a million Bitcoin.\\\\n\"}, {\"url\": \"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD/history/\", \"content\": \"2.44. -2.32%.
